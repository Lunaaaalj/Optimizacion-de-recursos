# Models Directory

This directory contains trained machine learning models and model artifacts.

## Guidelines

- Save trained models in appropriate formats (e.g., .pkl, .h5, .pt, .joblib)
- Include model metadata (hyperparameters, training date, performance metrics)
- Use model versioning for tracking different model iterations
- Document model architecture and training process
- Consider using MLflow or similar tools for model tracking
- Add large model files to .gitignore and use model registries
