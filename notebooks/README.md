# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration, experimentation, and analysis.

## Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive names for notebooks
- Consider using a naming convention like: `01_exploration.ipynb`, `02_modeling.ipynb`
- Include markdown cells to explain your thought process
- Clean up notebooks before committing (remove unnecessary outputs)
- For production code, refactor notebook code into the `src/` directory
- Use notebooks for exploration, not for production pipelines
