# DS-Template
Template repository for data science projects

## Project Structure

This template provides a standardized directory structure for data science projects, promoting organization, reproducibility, and collaboration.

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository as a template for your new data science project
2. Update this README with your project-specific information
3. Install required dependencies (add a requirements.txt or environment.yml file)
4. Start working in the `notebooks/` directory for exploration
5. Refactor reusable code into the `src/` directory
6. Write tests in the `tests/` directory
7. Document your work in the `docs/` directory

## Directory Descriptions

- **data/**: Store all data files. Keep raw data immutable and document transformations.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, experimentation, and initial analysis.
- **src/**: Reusable Python modules and production-ready code.
- **models/**: Trained machine learning models and model metadata.
- **reports/**: Generated reports, presentations, and visualizations.
- **references/**: Papers, manuals, and other reference materials.
- **tests/**: Unit tests and integration tests for code quality.
- **docs/**: Comprehensive project documentation.

## Best Practices

- Keep raw data immutable in `data/raw/`
- Write clean, documented, and tested code
- Use version control for code, not for large data files or models
- Document your process and findings
- Follow the principle of reproducibility
